----------Summarizes the analysis --------------
As the chief data scientist for the school district I took the standardized test results and created multiple charts to easily compare the each schools average scores for both math and reading, % overall passing score, school size vs test score, school type vs test scores, per student budget vs test scores. From this I went on to create visuals to compare the top performing schools with the bottom performing schools as well as the budget for each school. I also broke down the reading and math scores by grade from each school. From our analysis we can conlude the following:

----conclusions ----
1. according to the spending summary data frame, spending more per student did not mean the students would have a better score. The schools that spent $645-$680,the highest spending category, actually had the lowest average scores and the lowest % overall passing rate.
2. When comparing the top and bottom schools dataframes, the bottom performing schools had a larger total budget than the better performing schools.

   
4. The larger schools with 2,000-5,000 students had the lowest scores. Almost all of the schools with under 2,000 students were charter schools. 8 out of 9 charter schools had under 2,000 students. Charter schools took all 5 stop performing spots. school spenind data frame, top school df and bottom schools df.
