-----------Summarizes the analysis -------------- 
As the chief data scientist for the school district, I took the standardized test results and created multiple charts to easily compare each schools average scores for both math and reading, % overall passing score, school size vs test score, school type vs test scores, and per student budget vs test scores. From there I went on to create visuals to compare the top performing schools and the bottom performing schools as well as the budget per student for each school. I created a chart to show the reading and math scores by grade from each school. It may be helpful to compare test scores by grade within each school and across the district. From my analysis I can conclude the following:
----conclusions ----
1.	According to the spending summary data frame, spending more per student did not mean the students would have a better score. The schools that spent $645-$680, the highest spending category, actually had the lowest average scores and the lowest % overall passing rate. In comparison, the schools that spent the least tended to have higher testing scores.
2.	When comparing the top and bottom performing schools, the bottom five schools had a significantly larger total budget than the top five performing schools.
3.	The larger schools with 2,000-5,000 students had the lowest scores. 8 out of 9 charter schools had under 2,000 students. Charter schools took all 5 top performing spots. (via school spending data frame, top school df and bottom schools df)
